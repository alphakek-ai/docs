# Bridging to Base

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (33).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

To bridge your $AIKEK tokens to and from Base, we recommend using [**Superbridge**](https://superbridge.app/base?ref=blog.alphakek.ai) as your primary option. The process is straightforward:

1. **Deposit to Bridge:** Depositing $AIKEK is fast, with the bridging process taking approximately 5 minutes to complete.
2. **Withdrawals:** Please note that withdrawals may take slightly longer due to Base's policies. This is important to consider if you need quick access to your funds.

Visit the official Base bridge site [here](https://bridge.base.org/deposit?ref=blog.alphakek.ai).

{% hint style="info" %}
While there are third-party bridge apps available that offer instantaneous withdrawals, we have not yet tested them and therefore cannot recommend them at this time. If you choose to use other bridges, please do so at your own discretion. We will keep you updated as we evaluate and test additional options.
