# Bridging to Solana

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (31).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

To bridge your AIKEK tokens between Ethereum and Solana, we recommend using the **Wormhole Portal Bridge**. The process is straightforward:

1. **Select Network:** Portal Bridge supports various other networks, including Ethereum. Choose from Ethereum and to Solana.
2. **Connect Your Wallet**: Choose a wallet to connect to Portal Bridge. Click on “Next” to allow Portal Bridge access to your assets, then click “Connect” to link MetaMask with Portal Bridge.
3. **Select the Asset**: Paste the AIKEK [contract address](../tokenomics.md) into the asset field and choose Solana as your destination network.

We do not recommend third-party bridge apps. If you choose to use other bridges, please do so at your own discretion.
