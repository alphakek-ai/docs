<summary>What is Alphakek AI?</summary>

Alphakek AI is a pioneering technology lab focused on developing an AI infrastructure tailored for the crypto ecosystem. Leveraging custom, unbiased [AI models](../launch/universal-agents.md) and a comprehensive data engine named [Fractal](../fractal.md), Alphakek AI enhances crypto operations by providing sophisticated tools and applications. These include dynamic AI chat solutions and analytics platforms, helping users navigate complex crypto markets and make informed decisions with cutting-edge AI support.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What makes you different?</summary>

Alphakek AI distinguishes itself in both consumer and enterprise sectors with tailored solutions:

**Consumer:** Alphakek caters to individual users with tools like the [Alpha Chat](../research/ai-playground.md), which functions as a personal AI research assistant, helping crypto traders and enthusiasts gain real-time insights and perform in-depth market analysis without the complexity often found in traditional crypto research tools.

**Enterprise:** For enterprise clients, Alphakek offers robust B2B solutions including [APIs](../developers/developer-api.md) and [ai-agents](../launch/ai-agents/ "mention"), enabling businesses and large-scale projects to leverage powerful, bespoke AI capabilities. This includes everything from integrating unique market data to deploying specialized AI-driven analytics, enhancing their operational efficiency and decision-making processes in the crypto space.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How do I use your services?</summary>

Most of AI Apps on Alphakek.AI requires App Credits to run. App Credits can be earned by being a token holder or purchased for Ethereum. By owning $AIKEK, users will automatically receive App Credits at specific intervals.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What is $AIKEK token?</summary>

$AIKEK is the native token of the Alphakek AI platform, currently traded on [Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?inputCurrency=0x8dce83eca4af45dbe618da1779f9aaca43201084\&outputCurrency=ETH). As a deflationary and utility-focused cryptocurrency, $AIKEK is integral to our [Tokenomics ](../tokenomics.md)strategy. Holders gain access to AI applications and App Credits, enhancing platform engagement.

The token also plays a pivotal role in governance, allowing holders to participate in decision-making processes through voting, influencing the development and future direction of Alphakek's AI offerings. This token is a key part of our ecosystem, fostering user involvement and investment in our cutting-edge AI solutions.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What makes Alphakek AI decentralized?</summary>

1. Decentralized data sources and on-chain databases.
2. Decentralized governance, allowing token holders to vote on key decisions.
3. Decentralized AI processing.

Further, we offer permissionless APIs such as [wizard-api.md](../developers/wizard-api.md "mention").

While our AI models aren't yet decentralized due to their size, future updates will include fine-tuning based on token holder feedback.

Similar to the largest decentralized apps in crypto, we operate AI infrastructure where certain centralized elements are needed but aim to decentralize further as technology advances.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How do I participate in Alphakek AI's development?</summary>

At Alphakek AI, governance voting through [Snapshot](https://dao.alphakek.ai/#/) enables our community to actively engage in the development and direction of our AI technologies. This platform not only simplifies participation with its user-friendly, gasless system but also empowers users to influence key decisions and strategies, shaping the future of our AI solutions in alignment with community interests and values.

## Key Concepts

***

<details>

<summary>What is Alpha?</summary>

"Alpha" signifies a clandestine advantage, a veiled edge that empowers traders and investors to outmaneuver the market's chaotic whims. It encapsulates the arcane knowledge and enigmatic strategies that unveil opportunities before they manifest into the gaze of the common horde.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What is an API?</summary>

An API, or Application Programming Interface, is a set of rules and protocols for building and interacting with software applications. It defines the methods and data formats that developers can use to communicate with the API, effectively allowing different software systems to interact with each other.

APIs are used to enable the integration of systems, enabling new functionalities without having to start from scratch, simplifying development processes and connecting different technology components seamlessly.

The [Alphakek API](../developers/developer-api.md) is a core component of Alphakek's offerings and serves as a gateway for developers and enterprises to integrate Alphakek's advanced AI models and tools into their applications.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What are Large Language Models (LLMs)?</summary>

Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) are powerful tools designed primarily for general language understanding and generation. These models are trained on diverse internet text, making them versatile in many domains but not specifically optimized for Web3 and cryptocurrency applications.

The inherent generalist approach of LLMs can lead to gaps in their effectiveness in specialized fields such as crypto, where domain-specific knowledge, real-time data, and regulatory awareness are crucial. This discrepancy often results in outputs that are less accurate or applicable for crypto-specific decision-making.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What is an unbiased AI model?</summary>

In the field of finance, especially in cryptocurrencies, an unbiased AI model is crucial due to the highly speculative and volatile nature of crypto markets. Bias in AI models can lead to skewed data interpretation, which might misguide investment strategies or predictive analytics.

Unbiased models ensure that the AI's outputs are equitable and objective, preventing any systematic favoritism based on historical data biases. This is essential for maintaining fairness and trust in financial AI systems, which support decision-making in investments, risk assessment, and market analysis.

Our [AI Models](../launch/universal-agents.md) provide text outputs in response to their inputs. The inputs to these models are also referred to as "prompts". Designing a prompt is essentially how you “program” a large language model model, usually by providing instructions or some examples of how to successfully complete a task.

<summary>What is Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)?</summary>

AGI, or Artificial General Intelligence, refers to a type of AI that possesses the ability to understand, learn, and apply knowledge across a wide range of tasks, much like human intelligence. AGI contrasts with most AI systems today, which are designed to excel at specific tasks (narrow AI).

This capability makes AGI particularly significant for comprehensive applications in various industries, including finance and crypto, where it could autonomously analyze and react to rapidly changing market conditions without human input.

AGI is especially relevant to the crypto sector because it can execute complex, multi-step analysis autonomously. This capability supports more sophisticated trading strategies, risk management, and market analysis, providing a significant edge in navigating the complex crypto markets.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What are Autonomous AI Agents?</summary>

[agent-swarm.md](../launch/ai-agents/agent-swarm.md "mention") are specialized implementations of AI designed to operate independently in complex environments, executing tasks without constant human oversight.

The relationship between AGI and autonomous agents in crypto is pivotal: AGI could enhance autonomous agents, enabling them to perform more complex, multi-step analyses and decisions, akin to human-level reasoning and strategy in crypto trading and market analysis.

This could drastically improve their efficiency and effectiveness in navigating the volatile and complex cryptocurrency markets.
