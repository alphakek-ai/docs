# AIKEK vs. ChatGPT

Powered by our custom, uncensored [universal-agents.md](../launch/universal-agents.md "mention") and an extensive, up-to-date knowledge engine [fractal.md](../fractal.md "mention"), Alpha Chat transcends traditional AI limitations by integrating the latest market data and community insights from across the Web3 landscape.

¹ While ChatGPT is a general-purpose language model, Alphakek AI is specifically tailored for the crypto industry, offering in-depth integration with real-time and on-demand crypto data that includes smart contracts, DEX trades, on-chain data, sentiment analysis, and more.

² A "context window" in AI language models refers to the amount of text (measured in tokens) the model can consider at one time when generating responses. A token can be a word or part of a word, thus affecting how much information the model can process in one go.

* **ChatGPT**: Offers varying context windows—8K tokens for free users, 32K for paid users, and 128K for enterprise users, facilitating more comprehensive dialogues at higher levels.&#x20;
* **Alpha Chat**: Starts with a 16K token context window for chats, extendable to 128K, mainly for B2B clients due to increased resource needs.

However, unlike typical models, Alpha Chat leverages the [fractal.md](../fractal.md "mention") engine, which processes data through knowledge subgraphs, effectively enhancing the effective context window size by at least 5x without being constrained by token limits.
