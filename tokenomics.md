Holding [AIKEK](https://dexscreener.com/watchlist/fMG1wUlTB8htnF99eMeL) gives you a stake in AI's growth in crypto. AIKEK is currently **multichain**—Ethereum, Base, and Solana—so that AIKEK's tools are accessible to more traders and builders. Token contracts:

## Liquidity Growth

***

AIKEK spends revenue on buybacks. As AIKEK scales, buybacks also substantially increase, which results in lower supply.

* **Buyback & LP:** AIKEK’s deflationary design allocates 33% of protocol fees to a perpetual buyback LPs increase.
* **Revenue-Powered**: AIKEK is supported by Alphakek AI's revenue streams. As Alphakek AI B2C and B2B user base grows, so does AIKEK.

This two-front strategy gradually reduces supply and boosts demand over time.

## FAQ

***

<details>

<summary>How does being multichain affect my token holdings?</summary>

The total supply of 256,000,000 AIKEK tokens (minus burnt tokens) remains unchanged. Your ownership % only changes when we conduct buyback and burns.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How does being multichain impact the token price?</summary>

Given the total supply of AIKEK remains unchanged, the same supply and demand dynamics will impact price. While we cannot predict price changes, making AIKEK available on Base and Solana will increase its exposure, potential volume, and arbitrage opportunities between networks.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How will this impact token market capitalization?</summary>

Market cap is also aggregated across chains by coin listing sites like CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap.

<summary>Will this affect my Alphakek AI app access and <a data-mention href="guides/user-tiers.md">user-tiers.md</a>?</summary>

No, we calculate all of your holdings. If you hold $300 of AIKEK on ETH and $700 of AIKEK on Base, you still qualify for the $1000 Premium tier as usual. Solana AIKEK inclusion is coming soon.
