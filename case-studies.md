## CoinGecko

### Goal

Phase 1 of AIKEK's work with CoinGecko begins with an AI platform for their internal team use, designed to scale their content, brand, and marketing efforts. AIKEK is doing more AI R\&D with CoinGecko, as a part of AIKEK's new upcoming platform, codename [Fractal 2.0](guides/glossary.md).

### Results

* [Phase 1 platform output](https://x.com/coingecko/status/1963891936294805643)

### Announcements

## Virtuals Protocol

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (1).jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### Goal

AIKEK became a core agent in [Virtuals Protocol](https://x.com/virtuals_io)'s [Agent Commerce Protocol](https://x.com/virtuals_io/status/1892205912150114577) (ACP), offering generative memes, media, and narratives that scale. ACP is a new agent-to-agent economy, organizing the best autonomous agents into clusters that operate full businesses. Given AIKEK's early innovations and expertise in [generative graphics](https://x.com/alphakek_ai/status/1922707613252452633), this was a perfect fit. Later, AIKEK's role will expand to infra that supports multi-agent workflows.

### Solution

[#meme-generation](launch/ai-agents/#meme-generation "mention")

* Scalable, crypto-aware, and autonomous content generation, working on the Media House cluster alongside Luna
* Many new businesses in the agentic economy launch with little to no visual identity
* AIKEK is developing One-Shot Memes (previously "Remix"), a new way for any project to generate memes and other visuals
  * Projects can scale their content using minimal branding assets
  * On-brand, contextual visuals using only a single reference logo, mascot, or image
  * While staying aligned with current trends and narrative cycles
* In parallel, AIKEK is training more "universal" image generation models to support more creators and more platforms

[#aikek-memelord](launch/universal-agents.md#aikek-memelord "mention")

* Belongs to AIKEK's family of [universal-agents.md](launch/universal-agents.md "mention") that can integrate with any platform, anywhere
* Available via [memelord-api.md](developers/memelord-api.md "mention")

### Results

* Vertical AI's 10k+ registered users now have access to the model in Vertical Studio, in one click
* Has been a big hit in Vertical AI's community and is being used for their meme contests

[#aikek-memelord](launch/universal-agents.md#aikek-memelord "mention")

## Pudgy Penguins

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (14).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### Goal

Luca famously predicted that "who controls the memes controls the universe". For Pudgy Penguins and PENGU, AIKEK developed a suite of AI public goods for community members and builders. It's an ecosystem where memes breathe data, real-time data fuels memes, and the Pudgy Penguins community seizes the memes of production in one unified engine. The journey began in October 2024 when Pudgy’s leadership, [Aaron](https://x.com/AaronTeng?ref=blog.alphakek.ai) and [FoxyPenguin](https://x.com/FoxyPenguinApe?ref=blog.alphakek.ai), tasked us with further developing AIKEK's experimental [Pudgy AI v1 model](https://x.com/alphakek_ai/status/1850483099978899641).

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (16).png" alt="" width="563"><figcaption><p>Pudgy AI Ecosystem overview</p></figcaption></figure>

* All generated memes are automatically posted in the [Pudgy AI Lab](https://t.me/pudgyailab), a convenient public meme repository
* The [Twitter Banner Generator](https://x.com/alphakek_ai/status/1901554451103834347) allows the Pudgy community to create Pudgy-themed banners for their X profiles for any theme, campaign, or meta, using command /banner

[prompt-enhancer.md](create/prompt-enhancer.md "mention")

* Pudgy Penguins requires a unique level of consistency, curation, and quality control
* We developed a new NSFW and quality control filter to ensure all output is family-friendly and on-brand

[universal-agents.md](launch/universal-agents.md "mention")

* To enable AI-powered research of Pudgy Penguins and PENGU-related data, including onchain analysis, offchain news, and social sentiment, we started automatically collecting data in [fractal.md](fractal.md "mention") and making it available via [#aikek-wizard](launch/universal-agents.md#aikek-wizard "mention")
* The Pudgy meme model is also available to Pudgy Penguins builders via [#aikek-memelord](launch/universal-agents.md#aikek-memelord "mention")
* Both APIs are subject to Pudgy team approval
