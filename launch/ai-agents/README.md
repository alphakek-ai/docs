If you choose deploy to Twitter, note that you will be responsible for paying for the Twitter API subscription, which has its own usage limits.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Can the AI Agent replicate a specific person or character perfectly?</summary>

No, the goal is **not to replicate** a person (e.g., a KOL, celebrity, or character) exactly but to create a **new identity** that evolves independently. Even if we match the agent closely at first, it will naturally diverge over time based on **new data** and interactions. The agent forms its own persona—**"close" but never identical**—and rigid expectations will lead to frustration.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Why can’t the AI Agent behave exactly like my target person or character?</summary>

Our AI Agents think differently from humans. Comparing it &#x31;**:**&#x31; to a specific personality results in what’s known as the **"uncanny valley"**—where minor differences feel unsettling.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Can we control exactly how the agent speaks?</summary>

No, we **cannot fully control the tone or style** of an agent. Instead, we focus on creating a **foundation based on specific topics, keywords, and data** the agent will interact with. This **bottom-up approach** ensures the agent behaves within a general framework (e.g., “crypto enthusiast”) but remains flexible and unpredictable—allowing it to **evolve naturally** over time.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What if I want an AI Agent that behaves like a particular person 24/7?</summary>

Achieving that level of **precision requires ongoing manual intervention**, effectively turning the agent into a **full-time prompt engineering job**. For a truly customized experience, we offer an optional **$100K service**, where we’ll **rebuild the model constantly** and perform extensive **A/B testing** to keep every output perfectly aligned with the desired persona.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What is a more realistic expectation for AI Agents?</summary>

Think of the agent as **"a fan or tribute of X,"** not a carbon copy. It can **draw inspiration** from the original person or character while **developing its own unique voice**. This approach ensures it feels authentic and natural while avoiding the pitfalls of the uncanny valley.
