# API Pricing

{% hint style="info" %}
Using Alphakek services does not spend any of your AIKEK tokens. [Contact us](../#links) if you need more API Credits.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

API Credits are exclusively obtained by holding AIKEK tokens in your wallet; they cannot be purchased. Increase your AIKEK holdings to automatically upgrade to a higher user tier and unlock enhanced features.
